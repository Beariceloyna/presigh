Summary: We look at Apple launching a Savings account powered by Goldman Sachs, offering a 4.15% interest rate. Our analysis puts this into context relative to earlier launches of big tech neobanks â€” in particular the experience of Google, PayPal, and Ant Financial. Further, we look at the psychology and importance of high interest rates, and whether there is anything actually exceptional about that yield. We briefly cover the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade and its inflation / yield mechanics to highlight the difference between real and nominal returns.
